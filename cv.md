#### Brief information about yourself

My previous work experience was far from the IT field.

In parallel with the work, I began to learn Frontend technology.

In the process of studying, I realized that the IT-industry is very interesting for me, that I can be most effective only here. And I want to connect my professional activity only with the world of Frontend-development.

The goal is to become a full-fledged frontend developer, to develop further.

I believe in continuous learning, which improves my programming skills more and more !!!
